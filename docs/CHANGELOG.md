## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-25 - Initial Release

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
- Initialized Python 3.9+ project with Poetry dependency management
- Configured development tools: Ruff (linting/formatting), mypy (type checking), pytest (testing)
- Created project structure with modular architecture (api, cli, core, utils)

### Phase 2: Configuration & Models
- Implemented Pydantic v2 BaseSettings for environment configuration
- Created comprehensive `.env.example` template with NAPKIN_* variables
- Defined all 15+ Napkin AI styles with categories and mappings in constants
- Built Pydantic v2 models: VisualRequest, VisualResponse, GeneratedFile, StatusResponse, ErrorResponse, RateLimitInfo

### Phase 3: API Client
- Developed async HTTPX client with Bearer token authentication
- Implemented core endpoints:
  - POST /v1/visual - Create visual request
  - GET /v1/visual/:id/status - Poll generation status
  - GET /v1/visual/:id/file/:file-id - Download generated files
- Added Tenacity for intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- Built comprehensive error handling for 401/404/410/429 responses
- Implemented request/response logging with configurable levels

### Phase 4: Business Logic
- Created VisualGenerator with async orchestration
- Implemented polling workflow with configurable intervals
- Added support for both `generated_files` and legacy `files` response formats
- Built streaming file downloads with chunked transfer (64KB default)
- Developed intelligent filename resolution (Content-Disposition ‚Üí API metadata ‚Üí synthesized)

### Phase 5: CLI Interface
- Built Typer-based CLI with Rich terminal output
- Implemented commands:
  - `generate` - Create visuals with all API parameters
  - `styles` - List/filter available styles by category
  - `config` - Show/validate configuration
  - `version` - Display version information
- Added progress indicators and formatted output tables
